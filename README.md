# Ziqsbot

Bot made for my friend Ziqolu with the premise of demoting mods who attempt to mess with Permissions (Don't ask, 4chan server)

Uses my Bluebell as a core.

Not intended for public use, purely for documentation.

Never bothered taking the old token out of the config because it doesn't work
